/*
			----===[[[[ Virtools Language Pack File ]]]]===----

   Rules:
   First line must contain the string 'Language:' followed by the language name.
   The file may be seen as sections, each section name is enclosed in brackets ([,])
   Sections can have sub-sections, with names enclosed in brackets (<,>)
   For every section or sub-section, you can have as many entries as you want,
   which can be:	- strings (optionaly enclosed in quotes)
			- numbers
   Separators for entries are ',',';' or LF (line feed)
   Entries belong to the last section or sub-section specified, until
   a new section is reached. The first entry of the section has an index of 0,
   the next one, an index of 1, and so on.
   Comments can be added using the standard ANSI C++ scheme.
   Also, dont remove %s,%d and %f tags, those will be replaced at runtime by strings or numbers.
   A string can take multiple lines, adding \ at the end of the line means that the entry
   continues on the next line.

   NOTE FOR TRANSLATORS: DO NOT CHANGE ENTRIES ORDER IN THIS FILE!!!
